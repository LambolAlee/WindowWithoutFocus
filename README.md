# WindowWithoutFocus
create a window with Qt that will not steal the focus of other running applications but only can accept mouse events

---

### How to test the program
##### Step 1
run a text program such as notepad
##### Step 2
launch your application(In this step, your app can start with focus, that's not a big deal) and have "topmost" set to true
##### Step 3
click the notepad to transport the focus to it so it can get the cursor blinking in its text area
##### Step 4
click one button on your application without stealing the focus from notepad

### Success or Failure
if your app can work without any problem while you tapping any key the corresponding letters can apper in the text field, congratulations!
